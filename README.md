Dark Place is an open source Kristal mod that anyone can contribute to.

Well as it turns out Ralsei was wrong when he said that making Dark Fountains causes The Roaring, they just get weirder the more you make. Susie has been making them left right and center, and she is now on her 1000th fountain. Go and explore the world, there's lots to discover!

## Installation
Those instructions are intended to those who only want to play Dark Place. If you want to contribute, see **[Contributing](#contributing)**.

<details><summary>Installing Kristal's dev version</summary>

Kristal is the engine Dark Place was made on. As such, you will need it to play.

For diverse reasons, the mod currently only runs on **0.8.1-dev** which is not a released version, you will need to install the source code version of Kristal which can easily be done with the CI builds.

Simply install [the latest build](https://nightly.link/KristalTeam/Kristal/workflows/ci/main/output.zip) and open the archive.

![Inside the CI archive](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/755844178474303538/1143191651456655392/image.png)

If you are on Windows, you can simply extract the content of `kristal-0.8.1-dev-win.zip` in a folder anywhere you want on your computer and run the exe.

If you are on Linux or Mac, you'll have to install [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/) beforehand. After that, you can extract `kristal-0.8.1-dev.love` and run the love file.

</details>

<details><summary>Downloading Dark Place</summary>

After installing Kristal, download the latest version of Dark Place by clicking on the green button and then the "Download ZIP" one.

![The green "Code" button opens a menu where "Download ZIP" is available](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/755844178474303538/1143194072148881479/image.png)

Once the download is done, open Kristal and look in the main menu for the option called "Open mods folder" and select it. It will open a folder where you will have to place **the content of the archive**.

!["Open mods folder" option in Kristal's menu](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/755844178474303538/1143196297759826092/image.png)
![The content of the archive. The folder inside of the archive must be in the mods folder](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/755844178474303538/1143196297537531995/image.png)

After that, you can start the mod as you would start any other Kristal mod by choosing "Play a mod" and select Dark Place.

> *Note: if for some reason it doesn't work and you are sure you did everything correctly, join the [Kristal Discord server](https://discord.gg/8ZGuKXJE2C) to ask for help.*
